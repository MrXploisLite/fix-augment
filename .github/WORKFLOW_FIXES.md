# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes - Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the three failing GitHub Actions workflows.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed VS Code Extension Tests on ubuntu-latest

**Problem:** Tests were failing with "Missing X server or $DISPLAY" error causing SIGSEGV crash.

**Solution:** Added Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) setup for Linux runners.

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Added "Setup Xvfb (Linux only)" step before running tests
  - Split test execution into two conditional steps:
    - "Run tests (Linux with Xvfb)" - uses `xvfb-run -a npm test`
    - "Run tests (Non-Linux)" - uses standard `npm test`
  - Xvfb also added to the "performance" job
  
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
  - Added "Setup Xvfb" step before running tests
  - Updated test command to use `xvfb-run -a npm test`

**Technical Details:**
- Xvfb provides a virtual display server for headless testing
- The `-a` flag automatically selects a display number
- Required packages installed: `xvfb`, `libxkbfile-dev`, `libsecret-1-dev`

### 2. Fixed SonarCloud Scan Configuration

**Problem:** SonarCloud scan needed proper configuration and documentation.

**Solution:** Created dedicated configuration file and added setup documentation.

**Files Created:**
- `sonar-project.properties` - Complete SonarCloud configuration including:
  - Project key: `fix-augment`
  - Organization: `mrxploislite`
  - Source directories: `src`
  - Test directories: `tests`
  - Code coverage path: `coverage/lcov.info`
  - ESLint report path: `eslint-report.json`
  - Proper exclusions for build artifacts

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Migrated to `SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action@v5.0.0` with `SONAR_HOST_URL` preset to `https://sonarcloud.io`
  - Added conditional execution and warning message when `SONAR_TOKEN` is missing
  - Provided instructions for setting up the SONAR_TOKEN secret
- `.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md`:
  - Documented the new SonarCloud action usage and skip behaviour when the secret is absent

**Setup Required:**
- Repository owner needs to configure `SONAR_TOKEN` secret in GitHub
- See `.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### 3. Fixed Snyk Security Scan Authentication

**Problem:** Snyk scan failing with 401 Unauthorized due to missing/invalid SNYK_TOKEN.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive documentation for setting up Snyk authentication.

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Upgraded to `snyk/actions/node@v4` with an explicit `snyk test` command
  - Added conditional execution and a warning when `SNYK_TOKEN` is missing
  - Retained inline guidance for configuring the Snyk secret
- `.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md`:
  - Documented the updated Snyk action usage and skip behaviour when the secret is absent

**Setup Required:**
- Repository owner needs to configure `SNYK_TOKEN` secret in GitHub
- See `.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### 4. Fixed ESLint Deprecation Warning

**Problem:** ESLint warning about `.eslintignore` being deprecated in favor of flat config.

**Solution:** Migrated ignore patterns to ESLint flat config.

**Files Modified:**
- `eslint.config.mjs`:
  - Added `ignores` array as first element in config
  - Includes all patterns from `.eslintignore`:
    - `node_modules/**`
    - `out/**`
    - `dist/**`
    - `*.vsix`
    - `coverage/**`
    - `.vscode-test/**`
    - `**/*.js`

**Files Removed:**
- `.eslintignore` (no longer needed with flat config)

## Documentation Added

### New Files Created:

1. **`.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md`**
   - Comprehensive guide for setting up GitHub Actions secrets
   - Step-by-step instructions for:
     - SONAR_TOKEN setup
     - SNYK_TOKEN setup
     - VSCE_PAT setup
     - OVSX_PAT setup
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Technical details about workflow configuration

2. **`sonar-project.properties`**
   - SonarCloud project configuration
   - Defines all scan parameters
   - Configures coverage and quality reporting

3. **`.github/WORKFLOW_FIXES.md`** (this file)
   - Summary of all changes made
   - Technical details for each fix

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Test linting (should not show deprecation warning)
   npm run lint
   
   # Test compilation
   npm run compile
   
   # Test locally with Xvfb (Linux only)
   xvfb-run -a npm test
   ```

2. **CI Testing:**
   - Push changes to a branch
   - Open a pull request
   - Verify all CI checks pass (except those requiring secrets)
   
3. **After Setting Up Secrets:**
   - Configure `SONAR_TOKEN` in repository settings
   - Configure `SNYK_TOKEN` in repository settings
   - Re-run workflows
   - All checks should pass

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Tests run successfully on ubuntu-latest with virtual display**
- Xvfb setup added to all relevant workflows
- Tests execute with `xvfb-run -a npm test` on Linux

✅ **ESLint warning resolved**
- Migrated to flat config `ignores` pattern
- Removed deprecated `.eslintignore` file
- No more deprecation warnings

✅ **Proper documentation added for required secrets**
- Created comprehensive `.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md`
- Added inline comments in workflow files
- Clear instructions for SONAR_TOKEN and SNYK_TOKEN

⚠️ **SonarCloud Scan configuration complete** (requires SONAR_TOKEN secret)
- `sonar-project.properties` created
- Workflow properly configured
- Documentation provided for setup

⚠️ **Snyk Security Scan configuration complete** (requires SNYK_TOKEN secret)
- Workflow properly configured
- Documentation provided for setup
- Clear instructions for obtaining token

## Next Steps for Repository Owner

1. **Set up SonarCloud:**
   - Create/login to SonarCloud account
   - Generate API token
   - Add as `SONAR_TOKEN` secret in GitHub
   - See `.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for detailed steps

2. **Set up Snyk:**
   - Create/login to Snyk account
   - Get API token from account settings
   - Add as `SNYK_TOKEN` secret in GitHub
   - See `.github/ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for detailed steps

3. **Verify Workflows:**
   - Push changes to trigger workflows
   - Monitor Actions tab for any issues
   - All workflows should pass once secrets are configured

## Additional Notes

- The Xvfb fix is automatic and requires no additional configuration
- The ESLint fix is complete and requires no additional action
- Secrets need to be configured only once and will work for all future workflow runs
- All changes are backward compatible and don't break existing functionality
